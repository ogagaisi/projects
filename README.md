1. AdvanceCompAss-<br> This application mimics the behaviour of the MapReduce/Hadoop frame work.
It takes as its input two files representing a list of flight data containing details of passengers that have flown between airports over a certain period, and a list of airport data respectively. 
It determines the number of flights from each airport, creates a list of flight data (passenger id, departure time etc) based on flight id, and calculates the numerger of passengers per flight
